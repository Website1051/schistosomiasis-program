            <h2>What is Schistosomiasis?</h2>
            <p>Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a parasitic disease caused by blood flukes (trematode worms) of the genus *Schistosoma*. It is one of the most widespread neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affecting millions of people worldwide, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions with poor sanitation and limited access to clean water.</p>

            <h2>How is Schistosomiasis Spread?</h2>
            <p>The disease is transmitted through freshwater snails that carry *Schistosoma* larvae. When people wade, swim, bathe, or wash in contaminated water, the larvae penetrate their skin, entering the bloodstream and developing into adult worms. These worms settle in blood vessels, where they lay eggs that can cause inflammation and organ damage.</p>

            <h2>Symptoms of Schistosomiasis</h2>
            <p>Many people with schistosomiasis have mild or no symptoms in the early stages. However, as the infection progresses, symptoms may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Skin rash or itchy skin after contact with contaminated water.</li>
                <li>Fever, chills, cough, and muscle aches.</li>
                <li>Abdominal pain, diarrhea, and blood in urine or stool.</li>
                <li>Enlarged liver and spleen in chronic cases.</li>
                <li>Long-term complications affecting the bladder, intestines, liver, and even the brain in severe cases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Global Impact of Schistosomiasis</h2>
            <p>Schistosomiasis is a major public health issue in many developing countries, particularly in Africa, South America, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 200 million people are infected, with more than 700 million at risk of infection due to exposure to contaminated water sources.</p>

            <h2>Who is Most at Risk?</h2>
            <p>The disease primarily affects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Children playing in contaminated water bodies.</li>
                <li>Farmers and fishermen who rely on freshwater sources.</li>
                <li>Women who wash clothes in infested rivers and lakes.</li>
                <li>People without access to clean drinking water and proper sanitation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Efforts to Control Schistosomiasis</h2>
            <p>Controlling schistosomiasis requires a combination of strategies, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mass drug administration with **Praziquantel**, which is the primary treatment.</li>
                <li>Improving access to **clean water, sanitation, and hygiene** (WASH programs).</li>
                <li>Educating communities about **disease prevention and safe water practices**.</li>
                <li>Controlling the **snail population** in affected areas using environmental management.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Schistosomiasis and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</h2>
            <p>Efforts to combat schistosomiasis align with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SDG 3:</strong> Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all.</li>
                <li><strong>SDG 6:</strong> Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation.</li>
                <li><strong>SDG 1:</strong> Eradicate poverty, as schistosomiasis disproportionately affects low-income communities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Schistosomiasis remains a significant global health challenge, but with coordinated efforts, increased awareness, and proper interventions, it can be effectively controlled and eventually eliminated. It is crucial to invest in **prevention, treatment, and public health education** to protect vulnerable communities from this neglected tropical disease.</p>
